### Instructions

- The game has 2 screen:

1. *Menu*:
  
   - The player starts playing by pressing start with the mouse;
   - The player exits the game by pressing exit with the mouse.
  
2. *Gameplay*:
   
   - The game has 6 buttons:
     - Left arrow: Decreases the shot's power;
     - Right arrow: Increases the shot's power;
     - Up arrow: Aims up;
     - Down arrow: Aims down;
     - Space bar: Shoot the projectile;
     - Escape key: Exit the game;


### Solution Description


   For this project we had to make a physics based game.
   I decided to make a game where you are a little cowboy toy in a playing room, and you have to throw a ball into a basket.
   You can only land a goal if you bounce the ball off the rubber platform to remove the protection from the basket.
   But be careful, as there is wind every round in a random direction.
   The game is similar to what I envisioned, I expected for the bouncing platform to be in the same plane and direction as the basket, but bouncing off of a prependicular platform ended up making more sense.


### Metodology

    This game uses the trajectory physics equations for the movement of the projectile.
    Uses the drag equation for the wind, which changes the acceleration of the projectile.
    Uses bouncing by changing the speed of the projectile when it hits bouncy platforms.
    Checks for collisions by checking its area.
